# bvas: bayesian viral allele selection 

Welcome to the Github repository for *Inferring selection effects in SARS-CoV-2 with Bayesian Viral Allele Selection*.

This repo is organized as follows:
 - [bvas](bvas/): code for inference algorithms and simulations
 - notebooks: Jupyter notebooks demonstrate BVAS usage
   - basic_demo.ipynb: demo using simulated data 
   - S_gene_demo.ipynb: demo using GISAID data restricted only to the SARS-CoV-2 S gene
 - data: pre-processing scripts and (some of the) data used in the analysis
 - tests: unit tests for verifying the correctness of inference algorithms and other code
